divinum-officium-alterum
========================

This is a new implementation of `Divinum Officium
<http://www.divinumofficium.com/>`_, which is a collection of tools for generating
and presenting texts of the traditional Roman liturgy.

Why a new implementation?
-------------------------

There are several reasons, but they are weighty, and they all boil down to a
desire to improve maintainability and (in the longer term) functionality.
